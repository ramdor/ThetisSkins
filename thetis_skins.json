If you like the incremented sliders, I added three variations of them (Light, Medium, Black) to the slider pack download section. You can download them and install them into any skin where you think they might look good. Mixing and matching slider packs, button packs, and various skins is part of what makes customizing the software fun. You can always unzip the original slider pack right into the Console folder to restore the skin to the original sliders.",
